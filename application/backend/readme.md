FastAPI-based, Dockerized backend for the **VisKis** study. It handles the latin-square based randomization, computes the layout orderings, and stores the interaction data.
## Contents
- `server.py` – main logic, handling randomization, layouts, and logging
- `selfSort.py` – logic for the self-sorting algorithm
- `configLatinSquare.csv` – config file for 35 participants using a latin square based randomization.

## Setup
Run docker from the root repository!
